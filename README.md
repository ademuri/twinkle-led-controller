ESP32-based controller board which drives up to 10 strings of "twinkle" LED
fairy lights. These are strings of LEDs where half of the string is wired with
one polarity, and the other half with opposite polarity, so that one half or the
other (alternating down the string) can be lit up separately.

Work in progress.
